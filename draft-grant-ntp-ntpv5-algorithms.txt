1.  Introduction

   NTP version 4 (NTPv4) [RFC5905] defines various algorithms and logic
   which handle several different aspects of acquiring and sustaining
   synchronisation between NTP clients and servers including filtering
   of measurements, security mechanisms, source selection, clock
   control, as well as other algorithms.  Later Khronos [RFC9523]
   defined a companion method to run alongside to an NTPv4 client which
   aims to detect and mitigate time-shifting based attacks.

   However, NTP version 5 (NTPv5) [draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5] explicitly does
   not define synchronisation algorithms to allow for implementations to
   define their own which may be optimised for specific deployment use
   case or system constraints.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithm Considerations

   TODO: General considerations, including interop (When Algorithms
   Collide)

3.1.  Use of Extension Fields

   Algorithms may choose to require additional information be sent by
   either client or server, however this brings the risk of these fields
   not being sent by peers which do not support.  Algorithms SHOULD
   handle the absence of any extension fields and define behaviour when
   they are not present.

   TODO: Signalling of algorithms?  If so, this would likely require an
   IANA registry

4.  NTPv4 Algorithm use with NTPv5

   Support for NTPv4 algorithms is not required for any NTPv5
   implementation, however those supporting both versions of NTP may
   find it easier,

   TODO: Describe any adaptations that NTPv5 implementations have to
   make

5.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
